# SPL
Threat hunting Splunk queries for Bro, Zeek, or Corelight logs.

<br>

This is a work in progress.

## Next Steps

1. Gather SPL for all MITRE Techniques.
2. Check the SPL against Splunk instances to ensure indices and field names are accurate.
3. Develop extra SPL when summary indices are available.
4. Refine the queries. Many queries must be tailored to meet realistic thresholds. Some qureies may be removed or adjusted.
5. Improve the description for each quert; it should not only describe what will return, but why its worth looking at.
6. Determine which tactic and/or technique queries can be combined into a useful dashboard.
